## Abstract
Knowledge graphs are used in all kind of industrial and academical environments to store and work with knowledge. Knowledge and RDF are diversified techniques, to gain better knowledge from them, we need merging and validation as first steps in our workflows.

RDF does not have a default or recommended way to do such validation, therefore some promising approaches are appearing. But none of them is familiar to the widely know Object Constraint Language, which is the quasi-standard tool for constraint definition. 

We will show how transformation from OCL to SPARQL Inference Mod-eling, Shape Constraints and Shape Expressions can be done, to open this technique to the UML trained software developer and architects.
